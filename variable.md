#### There are two types of [[variable]]variables, [[numerical and categorical]].

1. [[numerical]] Numerical in other words quantitative variables, take on numerical values. It is sensible to add, subtract, take averages, etc., with these values.
	1. Numerical variables can further be categorized as [[continuous or discrete]].
		1. One example of a discreet variable is the number of cars a household owns.
2. [[Categorical]] or [[qualitative]] variables, take a unlimited number of distinct categories. Categorical variables that have ordered levels are called ordinal.
	1. f the levels of a categorical variable do not have an inherent ordering to them then the variable is simply called categorical
3. When two variables show some connection with one another, 
they are called [[associated or dependent]] variables.
The association can be further described as [[positive or negative]], and for these variables the association appears to be positive. 
If two variables are **not associated** they are said to be [[independent]].
