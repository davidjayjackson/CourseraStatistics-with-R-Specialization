Video 4: [[Sampling and sources of bias]], 

which occurs when the sample consists of only people 

who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue.]]
1. In this video, we will discuss a [[census]] versus a [[sample]], 
sources of [[bias]] in studies, and a few [[sampling methods]].
1.	[[exploratory analysis]] for the sample at hand
2.	If you then generalize and conclude that your entire needs salt, that's making an [[inference]].
3.	your sample, needs to be representative of your entire pot, your [[population]].
4.	[Convenience sample] [bias] occurs when individuals who are easily accessible.
5.	[[non-response]]. This happens if only a non-random fraction of the randomly sampled people respond to a survey, such that the sample is no longer representative of the [[population]].
6.	[[voluntary response]] [[bias]], which occurs when the sample consists of only people who volunteer to respond because they have strong opinions on the issue.
6.	In [[simple random sampling]], we randomly select cases from the population,
7.	In [[stratified sampling]], we first divide the population into homogenous groups called strata, and then randomly sample from within each stratum.
8.	In [[cluster sampling]], we divide the population into clusters, randomly sample a few clusters, and then sample all observation within these clusters.
9.	Lastly, [[multistage sampling]] adds another step to cluster sampling. 
Just like in cluster sampling, we divide the population into clusters, 
randomly sample a few clusters, and then we randomly sample observations from within these clusters
