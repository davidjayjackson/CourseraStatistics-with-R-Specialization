Video 5:  [[Experimental Design]]
1.	The [[four principles]] of experimental design are:
	1.	 [[control]], [[randomize]], [[replicate]], and [block].
	2.	 To [[control]],means to compare treatment of interest to a control group
	3.	 To [[randomize]], means randomly assigning subjects to treatments.
	4.	 To [[replicate]], means collecting a sufficiently large sample within the study or to replicate the entire study.
	5.	 The last principle of experimental design is [[blocking]]. If there are variables that are know or suspected to effect the response variable, first group the subjects into blocks based on these variables. And then randomized cases with in each block to treatment groups

2.	few new terms:
	1. A [[placebo]] is fake treatment, often used as the control group for medical studies
	2. [[Blinding]] is when experimental units do not know whether they are in the control or the treatment group
	3. [[double-blind]] study is one where both the experimental units and the researchers do not know who is in the control and who is in the treatment group.
