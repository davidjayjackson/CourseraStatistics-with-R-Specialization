1.	In this spotlight video, we will discuss [[random sampling]] and [[random assignment]], two concepts that sound similar, but serve quite different purposes in study design.
2.	[[Random sampling]] occurs when subjects are being selected for a study. 
	If subjects are selected randomly from the population. 
	1.	Therefore the study's results are [[generalizable]] to the population at large.
	
	2. [[Random assignment]] occurs only in experimental settings, where subjects are being assigned to various treatments.
	3. Through a [[random assignment]], we ensure that these different characteristics are represented equally in the treatment and control groups.
